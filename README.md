<h3>Project Title: </h3>
Health Hub 

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
In the current healthcare landscape, individuals often struggle to find a centralized and user-friendly platform that aggregates diverse health-related information and resources. Existing health websites may lack cohesion, making it challenging for users to access reliable information, schedule appointments, and engage in proactive health management. Additionally, ensuring the security and privacy of personal health data remains a paramount concern. This project aims to address these issues by developing a Health Hub Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed on the Azure Cloud platform. The objective is to create a comprehensive, user-centric online space where individuals can seamlessly access diverse health resources, schedule appointments, and engage in personalized health tracking. Leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure will ensure the scalability and security of the platform, providing a one-stop Health Hub that empowers users to take control of their well-being in a digital era.
